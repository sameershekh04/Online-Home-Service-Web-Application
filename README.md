🏠 Project Overview – Online Home Service Web Application

The Online Home Service Web Application is a dynamic web platform designed to connect customers with professional home service providers, such as electricians, plumbers, cleaners, and more. It simplifies the process of booking reliable services online by offering an easy-to-use interface, secure authentication, and real-time booking management.
